**WORK IN PROGRESS**

**go-dio** is a pure Go implementation of **DIO** the fundamental frequency estimation method.

DIO is one feature of [World](https://github.com/mmorise/World) the speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis system.

This version omits the downsampling function. If you want high speed, downsample the input in advance.
